      <h2> About</h2><br>
      <h3> The inspiration</h3><br>
      <p>Workerfy is a dream come through project for me. Before getting into the software engineering program I conceptualised the project of creating and application that will bring civil workers expecially brilliant civil workers who don't have more more and also can't advertise as it is expensive for them. A brief story of what brought about the conceptualising of this project is, one mornings when getting ready for work our noticed my water closet was not behaving normal, the what level in it was way up but at that time i was a bit late so i got caught up in the dilemma of what to do them i said to myself how i was wish i couldn't take my phone and find a plumber to do tjis work for me. Actually this turn to be a plan for me i took it upon myself to solve this problem. Not the main reason I join the software engineering program but one of the small reasons that make up the big reason. <br>
	For now Workerfy is just a test of my software engineering skills. I hope to take this project to the next level, a level where the name Workerfy will be a Globally household name.
